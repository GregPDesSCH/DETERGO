# DETERGO
## Interactive Ruby script by Gregory Desrosiers
**For the iOS App, [click here.](https://github.com/GregPDesSCH/DETERGO/tree/master/iOS%20App)**

This script file is a command-based calculator that approximately calculates how much laundry detergent you need to wash your clothes properly. 

It's based on what kind of laundry detergent you use, how much space the clothes occupy in the washing drum, how much dirt there is in the clothes, and how "hard" the water is. (Hardness being how much minerals there are in the water supply including calcium and so on; it can vary from time to time and from location to location.)

## How do I use it?

First, you need to [download and install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) on your system.

Next, download or clone this repository, and open a terminal. Navigate to the repository directory and type in
```
ruby detergo.rb
```

If you do this correctly and Ruby has been configured properly, you should see a logo made up of independent terminal characters. From there, you can then use the tool to figure out how much laundry detergent you need for your load by using your keyboard.



## What's currently on this project?

In this small project, there is one kind for a pod detergent (based on Tide PODS), one for liquid (based on Arm & Hammer Essentials), and one for powder (based on Tide Powder).

This is also a beginner project, as this is my first project written completely in Ruby.


## Resources used in designing the project
Some inspiration has been drawn from the following pages:
https://tide.com/en-us/how-to-wash-clothes/how-to-do-laundry/how-much-detergent-to-use
https://tide.com/en-us/how-to-wash-clothes/how-to-do-laundry/how-do-i-know-load-size-for-my-washing-machine

I also had inspiration into this project from a bottle of Arm & Hammer Essentials laundry detergent.
