#  DETERGO Laundry Detergent Calculator
#
#  This interpreted script written in Ruby approximately calculates the amount of
#  laundry detergent to wash the clothes a person has, given the amount of dirt,
#  how much room is used up upon loading, and the water hardness from the person's 
#  water supply,
#
#  This is themed after some guidelines from Tide on how to choose the right dosage
#  given the amount of laundry you have and how much dirt there is.
